## Stardot Cameras


### Access Configuration Back-end
1. Connect Camera to Laptop. Identify IP by typing `cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases`
2. Access `10.42.0.64` (netcamsc) via browser
3. Click `config`. Password admin.
4. Fix IP Adress: RED 123.45.67.1


### Image optimization
1. Hardware Focus: To focus the camera loosen the screw on top of lense, then gently turn the very first bit of the lense (not the ring with screw on). Turn left for close objects, right for far.  
2. Select Resolution and JPEG Quality

3. Select Exposure Grid ![Screenshot](./stardot/stardot_image-exposuregrid.jpg)

### Download Operating System
*Raspbian* is a free operating system optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. This *Debian* based *Linux* is has a big online community, is well tested and thousands available packages using *apt*.  
Here we downloaded the latest [*Raspbian Jessie Lite*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), released on 11th January 2017 with kernel version 4.4. I choose the lite version without the *PIXEL desktop* to save unnecessary disk space for archiving images. After writing the iso-image on the SD-Card using [Ubuntu's USB-Creator](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Live-USB/#USB-Creator-Startmedienersteller).  


### Access via SSH

**Getting Started with SSH only**
I don't have an external screen and get started using SSH only. Please see this [dedicated post](./raspberry/getting_started_ssh_only.md).  


### Initial configuration
For initial configurations open the [Raspberry Pi configuration tool](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md) as superuser: `sudo raspi-config`.  

#### Password
See `Passwords.md` (Obvious not in Git)  

#### Locale
1. Choose `4 Internationalisation Options`
2. ~~Change Locale to German UTF8~~ I'm fine with english
3. Change Timezone to Europe/Berlin
4. Change Wi-fi Country to `DE Germany`

#### Update
As seen with the failed Telekom-Hack the internet-of-things is tageted  by botnets. An up-to-date system prevents harm to the system and others. To close latest exploits update the system by typing `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt upgrade`.


### Install Additional Packages

* dns??

#### R
http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/55216

1. add `deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main` to `/etc/apt/source.list`.
2. `sudo apt-get update`
3. `sudo apt-get install r-base`

Installed Version: 3.3.2

### TwitterBot
The 21st century is the age of IoT. Here I use a twitter bot to get updated about the raspberrys status.


#### Prepare Scripts
1. Neuen Account anlegen, Profil auf [privat](https://support.twitter.com/articles/334631#) stellen um Tweets zu sch체tzen.
2. Create [new twitter bot](https://apps.twitter.com/). Save Credentials in `twitter_credentials.R` (**Not in git**)
3. Copy `tweet`-folder to RasPi.

#### Install R-Package

1. Install the following linux packages first `sudo apt install ilbssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev `
2. Install R-packages as root in case multiple users will access RasPi by: `sudo R`
3. and `install.packages("twitteR")`. Exit session by `q()`.

#### Activate
I want the RasPi to tweet its IP every time it boots. Additionally every morning at 9 am.

1. Append the following two lines in `crontab -e`:
2. `@reboot Rscript ~/tools/twitter_tweet-ip.R`
3. `* * * * * Rscript ~/tools/twitter_tweet-ip.R`


### Sendmail
**Receive IP via Mail at reboot**  
Knowing the RasPis IP adress is obligatory for connecting via SSH. Because the IP Adress can change, I want it to be mailed at reboot. Therefore I configured `ssmtp` according to [this guide](http://www.gtkdb.de/index_36_2296.html):

1. `sudo apt-get install sendemail libio-socket-ssl-perl libnet-ssleay-perl`
2. `nano /usr/local/bin/mailnotify.sh` (See `./raspberry/mailnotify.sh`, **NOT in git**)
3. `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mailnotify.sh`
4. `./mailnotify.sh "I am online" "$(ip route get 8.8.8.8)"` sends IP adress


debug:
change l:1933 from  `if (! IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL($SERVER, SSL_version => 'SSLv23:!SSLv2')) {` to `            if (! IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL($SERVER, SSL_version => 'TLSv1 ')) {`

Last but not least line 4 was placed in `crontab -e`:
`@reboot ~/mailnotify.sh "I am online" "$(ip route get 8.8.8.8)"`

+ sleep 30 seconds as seen [here](http://elinux.org/RPi_Email_IP_On_Boot_Debian), bacause assigning wifi takes some time.


### FTP Server
https://raspberry.tips/server-2/raspberry-pi-als-ftp-server-betreiben/


### Duplicate SD-Image
Identical configuration for both RasPis...  

1. Place configured RasPis SD-Card in Laptop. Create Image
2. Place empty SD-Card into laptop. Write Image

The images also specify the disc size. To make the rest of the 64GB available for files it has to be expanded. Make sure the sd-image is completly pre-comfigrured before next steps (after expanding the image as created above will be 64GB no matter how many disc-capacity acctually is used!)

1. Place pre-configured image in RasPi and boot
2. `sudo raspi-config`
3. **Expand Filesystem**...
4. `reboot`




# Setup 1
The initial setup trusts on the Stardot camera beeing connected to the internet all the time. This is the case when it's mounted to building and connected to the local router and the advantages of Stardot Netcam SC come into play.  
This setup is comparable to the *weucam* concept.  


## Technical Concept
The camera comes with integrated webtechnologies and uploads new images to a server via *File Transfer Protocol* (FTP) periodically. As discussed with Simon Sebold (IT manager at LSFE) the server could be either a RasPi integrated within the UniW체 network or a VM.

### FTP Upload
How/where to upload images to. Kameras stehen im Gel채nde, ohn OPENVP.


### Integrate in UniW체 Network
Indoor use () / Oder VM verwenden?

MAC Adressen:




## Setup 2
As discussed with Johannes Schamel, Manuel Engelbauer and Niklas Scheder on 2.2.2016 internet is not always available in the field. They prefer an autoneus setup storing images locally. The setup should depend only on energy supply. The researchers would go into the field to collect the data.  

**Therefore we need a RTC for RasPi!!**

### Technical Concept
![](./setup2_concept.jpg)

1. Connect RasPi w. Stardot via LAN
2. Fix IP?
3. PortForwarding 

**Use RasPi as timeserver for Stardot**
