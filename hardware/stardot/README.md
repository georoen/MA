# Stardot Cameras

## Fix IP
**TODO**

## Access Configuration Back-end
1. Connect Camera to Laptop. Identify IP by typing `cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases`
2. Access `10.42.0.64` (netcamsc) via browser
3. Click `config`. Password admin.
4. Fix IP Adress: RED 123.45.67.1


## Image optimization
1. Hardware Focus: To focus the camera loosen the screw on top of lense, then gently turn the very first bit of the lense (not the ring with screw on). Turn left for close objects, right for far.  
2. Select Resolution and JPEG Quality
