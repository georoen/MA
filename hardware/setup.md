### Download Operating System
*Raspbian* is a free operating system optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. This *Debian* based *Linux* is has a big online community, is well tested and thousands available packages using *apt*.  
Here we downloaded the latest [*Raspbian Jessie Lite*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), released on 11th January 2017 with kernel version 4.4. I choose the lite version without the *PIXEL desktop* to save unnecessary disk space for archiving images. After writing the iso-image on the SD-Card using [Ubuntu's USB-Creator](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Live-USB/#USB-Creator-Startmedienersteller).
